          <p>I believe that both my girlfriend (Brianna) and I can admit that conflict is a part of all relationships, and over time I believe that we have both improved in our conflict management including the application of anecdotes like “picking the right battles” or “letting things go”.</p>

          <p>So a couple months ago, when Brianna accused me of never replying to her messages - I knew that tangible proof that I do reply often was probably not a solution. </p>


          <p>But it did get me thinking - I was pretty sure that I could somehow get my hands on my chat history, either I could scrape it or use an third party app to pull it. And once I had the chat history, I knew that I could load it into python and parse/format the data.</p>

          <p>From there, it would be as simple as counting the number of messages ! (at least that’s what I naively thought). My experience in Python at that time consisted of simple scripts to make life easier at work and to automate the boring stuff (File manipulation, working with CSV files, and automated testing of ETL processes) .</p>

          <p> So although I knew enough to get my started, I knew that it was probably not going to be a walk in the park and I would need to learn more – but I was curious and motivated to reach my goal and find the truth (half-serious).</p>

          <p>So after checking with my girlfriend, I decided to document the journey of this project here. I will go over at a high level the process that I took, as well as what I found interesting along the way.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">High Level Summary</h2>

          <p>Downloaded FB Chat history in JSON - Turns out that I didn’t even need to scrape anything as Facebook makes it very easy to download your chat history in JSON format.</p>

          <p>Data Loading, Data Processing and Aggregation in Python using Pandas - I learnt about the Pandas library from a member of my team at work. It is an open source data science python library with DataFrame objects that makes it incredibly simple to manipulate data and perform analysis. I was happily surprised to find that it even has a function to convert JSON strings to pandas objects (among other tools for reading and writing data). Although Pandas was something new for me, it was incredibly easy to learn given its popularity (abundance of tutorials) and the fact that I had access to a pro at work that graciously allowed me to bug him with questions.</p>

          <p>Managed time stamps and special characters - timestamps needed to be standardized and converted from UNIX time.</p>
          <p>Tried out various method to plot the data -  Matlab was notoriously hard to use, Plotly was a better solution. </p>
          <p>Found out that it has already been done many times on the internet and kicked myself for not searching beforehand.</p>
